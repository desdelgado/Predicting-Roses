    "Dang, it seems that my girlfriend can predict almost half a round better than us.  I feel that again this is due to some of features such as \"Age Difference\" or \"Match City\" in our model having low correlation and low mutual information. Either these features do not particularly matter to a bachelorette or possibly the setting being a mansion in LA or New York removes some of the comfort/advantage of a similar hometown/culture from the equation.  That being said, being able to predict with a RMSE score of ~2 rounds does allow us to at least get a sense of if the contestant will be eliminated in the first few rounds or more towards the end of the show.  For example, if one contestant had a predicted round of 2 and an RMSE of 2, then we could guess they have a higher chance of being eliminated before someone with a predicted round of 8 and RMSE of 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, I would like to add other features to our table to try to improve the model. One idea that comes to mind is scraping twitter data about #bachernation's feelings about each contestant and do some sort of sentiment analysis.  The idea being that audience in the aggregate will have a good idea of who will make it far and will reflect those ideas via tweets.  Furthermore, I would like to explore trying to predict overall points in bachelorette fantasy.  Beyond contestants being eliminated, there are other ways for contestants to earn or loose points such as kisses, popping champagne, or crying.  This would lend me towards a more round by round approach using Bayesian statistics. The idea being that one would start with a distribution of possible points and with each episode that distribution would be updated.  Furthermore, this approach would mirror how audiences think about the game as their notions on each contestant are similarly updated round by round.  Though the modeling here didn't go as we planned, I still enjoyed constructing a dataset from scratch as well as learned a lot about the bachelorette. \n",
