# # Will you accept this model? Predicting love on the Bachelorette
# 
# # Part 2 
# 
# # Introduction
# 
# Going forward, I would like to only look at the bachelorette seasons since that is currently airing and being played fantasy wise. As noted, we have exhausted the low hanging fruit from the 538 dataset and need to look elsewhere.
# 
# When watching the most recent season, Hannah, the bachelorette, mentioned that one thing that makes one of her contestants, Jed, so attractive is that they come from the same southern background.  It's also been well documented that a good amount of people fall in people who are of similar backgrounds.  Thus, perhaps adding a categorical feature that tells us if the contestant is from the same cultural roots will help train our model.  To me, this question can be broken down into a few parts: same cultural region, same hometown, political leanings, and age.  I am sure there are other ways, but for now we'll focus on those four.
# 
# Before we go any further let's import the libraries and datasets from [part 1](https://github.com/desdelgado/Predicting_Roses/blob/master/Rose_Data_Engineering_P1.ipynb).

# ## Scrape and Organize Contestant Information from Wikipedia
# 
# Let's start with figuring out the cultural region.
# 
# To do this we first need to home town of every contestant and bachelorette.  On the contestant side, thereâ€™s luckily a [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelorette) page that has links to every season.  We can grab all those links and add it into a list for us to scrape.

# Each of these pages has a table with the contestant, age, occupation, hometown among other things.  Scraping this data turned out to be a wild ride because between finishing the project and writing it up, those wiki pages changed and instead of using pd.read_html, I needed to use beautifulsoup, etc. 
# 
# I'll quickly show how we can scrape the page and get the information into the dataframe.

# In[29]:


URL= 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelorette_(season_13)'
response = requests.get(URL)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'lxml')

My_table = soup.find("table",{"class" :"wikitable sortable"})

#Make a list to hold all the data we scrape from the HTML table
contest = []

#Search through the table class to find all the rows denoted by 'tr' in the HTML
for record in My_table.findAll('tr'):
        contest.append(record.text)

#Convert list into dataframe
contest_df = pd.DataFrame(contest)

#Turns out the column data is seperated by '\n's so we can use that to split it into a dataframe
contest_df = contest_df.iloc[:,0].str.split('\n', expand = True)

new_header = contest_df.iloc[0] #grab the first row for the header
contest_df.columns = new_header
contest_df = contest_df.iloc[1:]
print(contest_df.head())


# Cool, now the goal is to link the names to the names from the 538 table.  For example "Bryan Abasolo[5][6]" needs to be "13_BRYAN_A" and thus the hometown and age can be added to our overall table.  I choose this convention of "Season_Firstname_LastNameLetter" as it gives us unique names for each contestant and we don't have to worry about duplicate names.  
# 
# Below is a loop that takes in a wiki URL from the list above, finds the relevant information, sorts the data into the naming convention we want, and then saves it into an overall dataframe. For a more intricate explanation of the idea feel free to read the code comments.

This way we can mess around with the data and not worry about changing the original elim_data.

# ## Find the Cultural Region of Each Contestant
# 
# Remember the overarching goal was to use this hometown data to see if the contestants are from the same cultural region and even the same hometown as the bachelorette.  This leads into the question of how do we split up the "cultural" regions of the United States?  Digging around I found [this article](https://www.businessinsider.com/regional-differences-united-states-2018-1) where journalist Colin Woodard broke the US down into 11 different cultural regions.  While this map would have been great to use, it was difficult to quickly find a list of the counties in each of these regions.  Instead I found a [britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States/The-newer-culture-areas) article that gave a nice breakdown.  We can then make some lists of which states below in each region.  I know there are a bunch of ways to slice this and some states are in multiple regions, however, this breakdown is a good first attempt.

# In[37]:


new_england = ['Maine', 'Vermont', 'New Hampshire', 'Massachusetts', 'Rhode Island', 'Connecticut'] 
south = ['Alabama','Florida', 'Georgia', 'Kentucky', 'Louisiana', 'Mississippi'
         'North Carolina', 'Oklahoma', 'Virginia', 'West Virgina', 
         'Virgina', 'Maryland']
midatlatic = ['Pennsylvania', 'New Jersey', 'Delaware', 'New York']
upper_midwest = ['Ohio','Indiana', 'Illinois', 'Michigan','Wisconsin', 'Iowa', 'Minnesota','Nebraska',
                 'North Dakota', 'South Dakota', 'Nebraska']
lower_midwest = ['Kansas', 'Missouri']
northern_mountain = ['Montana', 'Idaho', 'Wyoming']
northwest = ['Washington', 'Oregon']
southwest = ['Arizona', 'New Mexico', 'Texas', 'Oklahoma', 'Arizona']
mountain = ['Colorado','Utah']
west = ['California', 'Nevada', 'Alaska', 'Hawaii']


# We can then write a function that will return the name of the region the hometown of the contestants are from.

# In[38]:


def findregion(ind):
    homestate = ind.get(key = 'Home State')
    if homestate in new_england:
        return 'New England'
    elif homestate in south:
        return 'South'
    elif homestate in midatlatic:
        return 'Midatlatic'    
    elif homestate in upper_midwest:
        return 'Upper midwest'
    elif homestate in lower_midwest:
        return 'Lower Midwest'
    elif homestate in northern_mountain:
        return 'Northern Mountain'    
    elif homestate in northwest:
        return 'Northwest'    
    elif homestate in southwest:
        return 'Southwest'    
    elif homestate in mountain:
        return 'Mountain'    
    elif homestate in west:
        return 'West'   
    #In case the contestant comes from outside the US
    else:
        return homestate


# Let's then grab the home state from the hometown column and then run it through that function.  Finally, we'll quickly check if there's any null values denoting we missed a contestant.

# In[39]:


running_table['Home State'] = running_table['Hometown'].str.split(",").str[1].str.strip()

running_table['Culture Region'] = running_table.apply(findregion, axis = 1)

#Check if there is any missing 
print('Number of missing contestants: ' +str(running_table['Culture Region'].isnull().any().sum()))


# Nice.  Now we need to get the bachelorette data to match. I went through the Wikipedia pages and put the hometown, season, and age of each bachelorette in an excel sheet.  I am sure given more time, there's a better computational way to do this but with only 13 entries sometimes you just gotta do it the hard way.

#Print out to see what we got
print(running_table[['CONTESTANT','Match City', 'Match Region']].head(20))


# We can see that some of the contestant's are even from the same hometown!

# ## Find the Political Leanings of each Contestant
# 
# Next, let's get the political leanings of each contestant.  Like with the previous features there's several ways to do this.  At first glance, we could assign each state conservative or liberal based on who they voted for in 2016.  After digging around, however, I found this concept called the [Cook Partisan Voting Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index) (PVI) where each state is assigned a political leaning and a number where that number is the difference between the country's average and the state average.  For example, Alabama is Republican +15 which means if the country voted say 40% republican Alabama voted 55% republican.  While we could try to go down to the district level, let's use the stateâ€™s first. 
# 
# On a different note, while writing this up the wiki article changed multiple times.  So, for the sake of reproducibility, I will write the scrape code into comments and load the data from a saved csv file.

# Before matching these numbers to the contestants, I did notice some of the contestants (and even a bachelorette!) are from Canada.  So, let's first grab the PVI for the different Canadian territories so we don't miss out on that data. We can go to Canada's Wikipedia page that has a table of the territory and each respective political leanings.  Like the PVI wiki page, this page changed multiple times even while writing this project up.

# We can assign PVI numbers to each territory based on its leanings.  For example, we can denote "Centre-right" as 5.  Having some foresight, when we get around to assigning PVI numbers to contestants, let's make democrats negative numbers and republicans positive.  This way when we can take the difference in PVI numbers between contestants and bachelorettes, couples that lean in different ideologies will have a bigger difference.  Moreover, we can make this assumption cause in the 2016 election roughly the same number of people voted conservative and liberal.

# ## Conclusion
# 
# Awesome, in [part 3](https://github.com/desdelgado/Predicting_Roses/blob/master/Predicting_Roses.ipynb), we'll look at trying to apply machine learning techniques to this constructed data set.  Obviously, there is other data we could add in such as pick order, make the PVI numbers more refined, or look at physical height differences.  I think, however, an important part of any open-ended project like this is determining when to stop.  Thus, let's try to apply some techniques to get started and let that guide us to see if we need to come back and improve.
